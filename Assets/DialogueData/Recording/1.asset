    No one tells you how bored you''re going to be, being
    in Hell for all eternity.'
  - 'I need a plan to escape, but how?

    If I can get someone
    to play it, I can take their energy over time.'
  - 'When I have enough energy, I can possess them.

    Leaving this miserable place!'

    So
    many versions of myself, I could take over the world!'
