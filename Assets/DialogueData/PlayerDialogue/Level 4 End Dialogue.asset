  dialogue:
  - So down there is going to be the end?
  - I'm trying to remember what happened to me...
  - Was it...?
  - A car accident?
  - I remember falling...
  - I think I drove off something, like a bridge.
  - And then I was torn from my reality into this one.
  - The only thing I've been able to do here is fight.
  - One last fight.
  - Then I can rest.
