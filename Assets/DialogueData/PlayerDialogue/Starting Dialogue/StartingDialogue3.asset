  dialogue:
  - Nevermind about that...
  - I've been stuck in this game for what feels like an eternity!
  - 'This is going to sound crazy but...

    I''m real, not just code in a game.'
  - 'I was put in this game by someone with a god complex that likes to trap innocent
    people like me.

'
  - 'I''m now a game character and can''t move on my own.

    I need a player to
    control me.'
  - 'The game is set in Hell, Dante''s 9 circles to be exact.

    I am trapped in
    the center, Treachery

'
  - 'I think if we escape I could go back to my body.

    You have to believe me!'
  - 'Even if you don''t, why not finish the game anyway?

    It doesn''t matter
    to you if I''m real or not.'
  - Finish the game and free me, PLEASE!
