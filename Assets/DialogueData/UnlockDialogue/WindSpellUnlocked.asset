  - 'Oh...

    I think gaining experience from killing Demon''s has given me some
    power.'
  - 'Let me try something, one moment...

    ...

    ...'
  - 'YES!

    I''ve unlocked a cheat for the game that will help us.'
  - 'Type in ''{console}''

    It will bring up a console'
  - 'Type in wind_spell and press enter.

    Then press tab to switch to that spell.'
  - 'If you forget, you just need to type help into the console.

    It will show
    what cheats are unlocked.'
  - 'It will knock enemies back slightly.

    It''s much faster than fire but does
    a lot less damage.'
  - I guess it could help when you're surrounded.
  - 'Happy to help, {playerName}!

    :D'
